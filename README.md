# Coordinary

## What is it?

A one-week 5-person full-stack project. We started the week without knowing our concept, and finished the week with Coordinary: a wish-list registry for charitable donations. For obvious reasons around charity-vetting and payment handling, this is a toy-project rather than something available for real use.

## A summary of technologies used

The front-end is a SPA with React and TailwindCSS. It's backed by an Express.js server, a KNEX SQLite database, and Auth0 authentication. Payment portal provided by Stripe.

## What was my contribution?

I served on the project as an informal tech-lead. I was lead trouble-shooter, took responsibility (along with our Agile Manager) for projecting time-frames, and personally solved any last minute problems.

You can see my specific commits and bug-fixes, but here's a brief summary of the large features I worked on:

- Built the Charity Admin Portal (Frontend, API, database)
- Integrated Stripe
- Designed the Model + Database
